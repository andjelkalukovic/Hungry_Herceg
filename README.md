* After choosing the restaurant, users can make meal orders, combinations of meals, etc. 
* The available user is Pera with password 1234.
* There is also user Admin with password 1234. The admin has access to one setting page where can add or delete restaurants, meals, and users (users are employees at the company that uses this application).
